# Flashcards
A very primitive flashcard program designed to help me memorize Hiragana for my Japanese course.

## Author
- Cole DenBleyker

## Prerequisites
- A IDE that can compile Python programs (i.e. VSCode, Pycharm, etc.)

## NOTICE FOR WINDOWS USERS
- Windows updates will come way after MacOS releases. 
- Any release besides V1.0.0 will specificially mention if there is a Windows release available.
- If the release does not say that there's a Windows version then you will have to use an older version for the time being.

## How to Run
1. ~~~Go to releases~~~
2. ~~~Download the latest release~~~
3. ~~~Run the executable~~~
4. Learn some basic Hiragana!

If you are on Windows and want an updated standalone version, then you WILL have to compile it yourself if there's no Windows standalone release with the update
## Alternative way to run
1. Clone or download the repository and go to the root directory.
2. Run 'flashcards.py' in your choice of IDE
You can use a bundle compiler to make it a single executable.


## Known Bugs and Disclaimers
Disclaimers:
- !!!THIS IS VERY PRIMITIVE JAPANESE HIRAGANA!!! I am in a beginner Japanese course. This will receive updates as I learn more Hiragana.
- Score does NOT save when if you restart the program (maybe in the future I'll figure out a way to store past scores)
- Windows standalone releases will take longer (if they even come out) due to not having access to a Windows machine. If you want the latest release you will have to compile it on your own.

Known Bugs:
- Currently there are none! ðŸŽ‰ (if you find one submit an issue)

## Plans for the Future
This is a list of all plans for this program. This is NOT in any kind of order. They will be added as I please.
- Possibly make a .csv file to store Hiragana and corresponding translations (would make adding words easier)
- Add Katakana and corresponding translations
- Add Kanji and corresponding translations
- When more complex words are added, add a hint button that will assist in guessing the word
- Add either a navbar or menu button to allow switch between Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji (or even a mixture of what styles)
- Possibly fix code formatting (i.e. make things secure, cleaning up how some things look)
- Adding Linux support (to be honest I don't see this happening at all but I'm all for multiplatform support)

## Completed Plans
- ~~~Made a standalone product (albeit primarly for MacOS)~~~
- Added Windows support (!!very limited!!)
- Corresponding colors to what your answer was
- Added a ratio to determine accuracy
- Fixed all current bugs

## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed spacing between components
- Fixed window size
- Removed most Visual Errors
