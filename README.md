# Flashcards
A very primitive flashcard program designed to help me memorize Hiragana for my Japanese course.

## Author
- Cole DenBleyker

## Prerequisites
- A IDE that can compile Python programs (i.e. VSCode, Pycharm, etc.)

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository and go to the root directory.
2. Run 'flashcards.py' in your choice of IDE

## Known Bugs and Disclaimers
Disclaimers:
- !!!THIS IS VERY PRIMITIVE JAPANESE HIRAGANA!!! I am in a beginner Japanese course. This will receive updates as I learn more Hiragana.
- I am aware that the spacing is all wack
- The window size is weird 
- Most visual errors are due to my very primitive knowledge of tkinter
- Score does NOT save when if you restart the program (maybe in the future I'll figure out a way to store past scores)

Known Bugs:
- The formatting of some prompts cause the window to change sizes
- Resizing the window does not properly 

## Plans for the Future
This is a list of all plans for this program. This is NOT in any kind of order. They will be added as I please.
- Add a ratio between correct guess to overall guesses
- Make this a standalone application so all you would have to do is download it
- Possibly make a .csv file to store Hiragana and corresponding translations (would make adding words easier)
- Add Katakana and corresponding translations
- Add Kanji and corresponding translations
- When more complex words are added, add a hint button that will assist in guessing the word
- Add either a navbar or menu button to allow switch between Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji (or even a mixture of what styles)
- Fix spacing between sections
- Fix scaling when window is resized
- Fix formatting of window
- Possibly fix code formatting (i.e. make things secure, cleaning up how some things look)
