# Flashcards
A very primitive flashcard program designed to help me memorize Hiragana for my Japanese course.

## Author
- Cole DenBleyker

## Prerequisites
- A IDE that can compile Python programs (i.e. VSCode, Pycharm, etc.)

## NOTICE FOR WINDOWS USERS
- Windows updates will come way after macOS releases. 
- Any release besides V1.0.0 will specificially mention if there is a Windows release available.
- If the release does not say that there's a Windows version then you will have to use an older version for the time being.

## How to Run
1. ~~Go to releases~~
2. ~~Download the latest release~~
3. ~~Run the executable~~
4. Learn some basic Hiragana!

~~If you are on Windows and want an updated standalone version, then you WILL have to compile it yourself if there's no Windows standalone release with the update~~
## ~~Alternative~~ The only way to run
1. Clone or download the repository and go to the root directory.
2. Run 'flashcards.py' in your choice of IDE
You can use a bundle compiler to make it into an executable for your own convience


## Known Bugs and Disclaimers
Disclaimers:
- !!!THIS IS VERY PRIMITIVE JAPANESE HIRAGANA!!! I am in a beginner Japanese course. This will receive updates as I learn more Hiragana.
- Score does NOT save when if you restart the program (maybe in the future I'll figure out a way to store past scores)
- Windows standalone releases will take longer (if they even come out) due to not having access to a Windows machine. If you want the latest release you will have to compile it on your own.
- You WILL have to compile this yourself. I cannot code sign for macOS because I don't have a developer account so any single executable I make for macOS will not run on anyone else's machine

Known Bugs:
- Currently there are none! ðŸŽ‰ (if you find one submit an issue)

## Plans for the Future
This is a list of all plans for this program. This is NOT in any kind of order. They will be added as I please.
- Possibly get an Apple Developer account so I can sign the program so that a standalone would actually work (this is extremely unlikely b/c its $99/year)
- Possibly make a .csv file to store Hiragana and corresponding translations (would make adding words easier)
- Add Katakana and corresponding translations
- Add Kanji and corresponding translations
- When more complex words are added, add a hint button that will assist in guessing the word
- Add either a navbar or menu button to allow switch between Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji (or even a mixture of what styles)
- Possibly fix code formatting (i.e. make things secure, cleaning up how some things look)
- Adding Linux support (to be honest I don't see this happening at all but I'm all for multiplatform support)

## Completed Plans
- ~~Made a standalone product (albeit primarly for macOS)~~
- Added Windows support (!!very limited!!)
- Corresponding colors to what your answer was
- Added a ratio to determine accuracy
- Fixed all current bugs

## Fixed Bugs
- Fixed spacing between components
- Fixed window size
- Removed most Visual Errors
